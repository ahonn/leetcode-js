 *
 * Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
 * return its modified list.
 *
 * k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the
 * linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out
 * nodes in the end should remain as it is.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
 *
 * For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
 *
 * For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Only constant extra memory is allowed.
 * You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be
 * changed.
